\title{Filter candidate polygons by ground truth containment}
\usage{
filter_by_ground_truth(candidates, truth, threshold = 0.75)
}
\arguments{
\item{candidates}{An sf polygon object (e.g., extracted buildings).}

\item{truth}{An sf polygon object representing ground truth.}

\item{threshold}{Minimum containment ratio (default 0.75).}
}
\value{
Filtered sf object containing only accepted polygons.
}
\description{
Filters candidate building polygons using a ground-truth polygon set.
Keeps candidate polygons whose area is sufficiently contained
within intersecting ground-truth polygons.
